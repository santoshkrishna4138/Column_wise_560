# Column_wise_560
This is the repository containing the column-wise implementation of matrix multiplication for the matrix dimension of 560 x 560. I have also assumed that the first matrix is a sparse matrix with the NNZ=8960.
 Additionally, the sparse matrix is stored in the COO format.
Other than the files included in the repository, in order to run the code, the following Xilinx IPs will have to be instantiated with the settings for each described below.
